# COP3337-MiniProject-Inheritance
This is a COP3337 ungraded assignment project based on inheritance concepts for Profesor Richard Whittaker

NOTE:
This is my first ever project working with GIT. Because of this multiple commits are made as I test multiple commands and actions with GIT. Some commits might usually be unnecesary as I was just testiong using the repo to work on the same code from both my linux and windows machine.
